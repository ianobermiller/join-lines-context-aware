## Features

- Merge string literals - single or double quote, `+`, `.`, or nothing as concat operator
- Merges line and docblock comments (supports `//`, `#`, `*`, and `;`)
- Removes trailing commas and omits spaces when merging onto a line with an opening or closing brace (`[]`, `{}`, `()`, or `<>`)

## Usage

After installing the extension, add a keybinding for it. The default Join Lines
command is `ctrl+j` or `cmd+j` on Mac.

```
{
  "key": "ctrl+j",
  "command": "join-lines-context-aware.join"
}
```
